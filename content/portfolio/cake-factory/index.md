In this project, my team and I created a website for a fictional cake factory. The website allows users to place orders, pay via paypal, and view their order history. There is also an admin panel that allows the owner to view orders, edit orders, and view analytics.

I worked on ERD design, CRUD API implementation, PayPal and ReCAPTCHA integration, and building out the shopping cart feature.

This site is built with a combination of .NET Core, Entity Framework, and Razor Pages.

One of the most challenging parts of this project was figuring out how to represent a fully modular product in our database structures. We also needed to provide the option of several pre-built options, which added a further complexity to the design process. I learned a lot about building accurate schema, and how to represent business logic in code.
