Of Swords is one of the first things I ever programmed. It's a small melodrama told in a series of vingettes.

Though not as impressive of a programming feat as I'm now capable of, and a bit janky now, I have a bit of a soft spot for it.
It won "Best Characters" and "Most Emotionally Impactful" in the ([Twine 10 Year Anniversary Jam](https://itch.io/jam/twine-10-year-anniversary-jam)), and came in second overall.
